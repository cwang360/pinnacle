## Keyboard Posture Optimizer
Typing websites and competitions can only do so much with helping you learn to type quickly; they'll be able to see that you're pressing the right keys, but what's to stop you from using the same finger to handle half the keyboard? Not only are these bad habits are difficult to get rid of, but they are also difficult to track and realize.

Keypo utilizes an optical hand-tracking module, the Leap Motion Controller, as well as the 10-finger typing method, to detect finger-pressing gestures while you type to help you correct bad habits and learn to type faster, faster.
